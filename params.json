{"name":"Yaps - Yet Another Photo Sorter","tagline":"Manage your photo archive: automatically copy and sort your photos into folders based on date and time of creation (EXIF).","body":"### Feeling overwhelmed by the mass of photos you need to manage? \r\nTodays digital cameras are really nice as they let us create photos for almost no cost. We can try out things and shoot 10 or more pictures of the same motive and later decide what we want to keep. However this has a bad side effect: We are producing too many pictures!\r\n\r\nOrganizing this constant growing mess can be a daunting task. We copy the content of our SD-cards to disk and then wonder how to name the folder. April_2012? Seems good. Wait, there are also some photos from Januar in it. Januar-April_2012? Obviously this is not very helpful.\r\nWe end up having several folders with different names containing lots of duplicate photos because we weren't sure that we really copied them before.\r\n\r\n### So what's the solution Mr. smartypants?\r\nThe simple answer is: don't manage your photos manually! Let the computer do the job. He won't complain.\r\nDigital photos or videos contain lots of meta data, for example the date and time when the photo was taken. This is different from normal file dates: It won't change, no matter where, when and how often you copy or move your images. We just need to gain advantage of this and use a tool that generates folder names and sorts our stuff nicely into it, renaming files, cleaning up duplicates. Simple!\r\n\r\n### One tool to rule them all\r\nLuckily YAPS is here to help you.
