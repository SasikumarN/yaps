<p>Today's digital cameras are really nice as they let us create photos for almost no cost. We can try out things and shoot 10 or more pictures of the same motive and later decide what we like the most. However this has a bad side effect: We are producing too many images!</p>

<p>Organizing this constant growing mess can be a daunting task. We copy the content of our SD-cards to disk and then wonder how to name the folder. April_2012? Seems good, but wait, there are also some photos from January in it. January-April_2012? But there is a folder January_2012 already! Obviously this is not very helpful.
We end up having several folders with different names containing lots of duplicate photos because we weren't sure that we really copied them before.</p>

<p>The simple answer is: don't manage your photos manually! Let the computer do the job. He won't complain.
Digital photos or videos contain lots of meta information, for example the date and time when the photo was taken. This is different from normal file dates: It won't change, no matter where, when and how often we copy or move our images. We just need to gain advantage of this and use a tool that generates folder names and sorts everything nicely into it, renaming files, cleaning up duplicates. Simple!</p>
